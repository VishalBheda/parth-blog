hey guys.. how you doing..? i hope you all are enjoing. This time we will doing **something** on my favorite topic, Computer Vision. 

What is it…? computer vision is a spacial branch related to computer science, machenical, roboticas, auto mobile and so on. Computer vision is concerned about image processing, extrect information from images or videos(multiple frames in sequence) in short working with multi-dimension data(pixel data).

Why this is important..? bacause of long applications list of computer vision like authentication with cemera, autonoms cars, robotics, image filtering, image generation, style transfering and so on….

I hope you liked last post about introduction to sklearn, model building pipeline with sklearn and we wrap up with simple classification with fake data whare we create cat and dog data with only two features. In this post we will continue same example(classification) with real images with sklearn. so this is again image classification problem you can check out keras cat dog classification.
