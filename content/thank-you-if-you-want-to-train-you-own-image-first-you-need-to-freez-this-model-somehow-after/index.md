thank you, if you want to train you own image first you need to freez this model somehow after training, so you don’t have to train it every time. see this ([http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/model\_persistence.html](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/model_persistence.html))

after training and storing model, you can make you image on paint using brush and preprocess images using openCV, or pillow. don’t forget to make your image same size and shape as training data has. feel free to reach me at parthvadhadiya424@gmail.com.
